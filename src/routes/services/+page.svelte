				</span>
				<p>
					Individualized, prescriptive reading instruction designed to close the gaps for struggling
					readers or set up young students for a lifetime of success with reading. Each student will
					be taught using multi-sensory strategies from programs such as Lindamood-Bell's Seeing
					Stars or Visualizing & Verbalizing and the Orton-Gillingham method. Students will build
					their confidence and love for reading one session at a time. Movement and games are
					incorporated to keep sessions active, motivating and fun. Sessions can take place
					in-person, through Zoom or at the child's school during the day if an arrangement is made.
