			<h2 class="h3">What ages do you work with?</h2>
			<p class="mt-2">
				My approach works with learners of all ages, but it is most suited for those in Kindergarten
				through 5th grade. Older student who are struggling with foundational reading skills like
				decoding or spelling will also benefit from Orton Gillingham instruction.

			<h2 class="h3">What do tutoring sessions entail?</h2>
			<p class="mt-2">
				Each session is 50 minutes long and is tailored specifically to the student's needs. All
				instruction is prescriptive, systematic and multi-sensory. I utilize strategies from
				Lindamood-Bell Learning Processes and the Orton-Gillingham approach to develop the
				sensory-cognitive abilities needed for success with reading and writing. Movement and games
				are incorporated to keep sessions lively and fun. In addition to working on literacy skills,
				I encourage each student to develop a growth mindset about their academic abilities, and we
				work together to keep track of their progress and celebrate their successes.

			<h2 class="h3">How many sessions are required and how long will it take to see progress?</h2>
			<p class="mt-2">
				Students enrolled in tutoring are required to take at least 1 session of tutoring per week,
				excluding holidays. For students who are more than a grade level behind in reading or are in
				need of fast remediation, 2 - 3 sessions per week is recommended. Closing the gap in reading
				takes time and effort, so each child's progress will be closely monitored from week to week
				in order to design personalized lesson plans for their current needs. In addition, formal
				testing measures will be re-administered every 8 months to get an updated reading profile.

			<h2 class="h3">How does tutoring work over Zoom?</h2>
			<p class="mt-2">
				With the right technology, students can experience fun, multi-sensory reading intervention,
				even online! I utilize the white board feature and multiple online resources to deliver
				instruction. As long as students have access to a touch screen (iPad preferred), they can
				use a stylus to practice handwriting and work on decoding skills while receiving sensory
				feedback. Even students who struggle with sustained attention will enjoy the movement games
				and fun activities that are designed to motivate them through each session.

			<h2 class="h3">Why do I need an advocate?</h2>
			<p class="mt-2">
				As someone who has worked as a special education teacher in the public school system, I know
				that while school staff always have the best intentions, they may feel limited in what
				services they can provide or not have the best understanding of your child's needs. The laws
				and terminology surrounding the education of students with disabilities are complex and can
				be daunting for a parent to navigate. I will be there to walk you through the process by
				listening to your concerns for your child's education and advocate for that to be reflected
				in their Individualized Education Plans. This service is complimentary for families enrolled
				in tutoring, but I encourage any family that has a student with an IEP or who is looking to
				get the process started at their school to reach out to me and see how I can support you in
				ensuring your child's educational needs are met at school.
