			<h2 class="h3">What ages do you work with?</h2>
			<p class="mt-2">
				My approach works with learners of all ages, but it is most suited for those in Kindergarten
				through 5th grade. Older students who are struggling with foundational reading skills like
				decoding or spelling will also benefit from Orton-Gillingham instruction.

			<h2 class="h3">What do tutoring sessions entail?</h2>
			<p class="mt-2">
				Each session is 50 minutes long and is tailored specifically to the student's needs. All
				instruction is prescriptive, systematic and multi-sensory. I utilize strategies from
				Lindamood-Bell Learning Processes and the Orton-Gillingham approach to develop the
				sensory-cognitive abilities needed for success with reading and writing. Movement and games
				are incorporated to keep sessions lively and fun. In addition to working on literacy skills,
				I encourage each student to develop a growth mindset about their academic abilities, and we
				work together to keep track of their progress and celebrate their successes.

			<h2 class="h3">How many sessions are required and how long will it take to see progress?</h2>
			<p class="mt-2">
				Students enrolled in tutoring are required to take at least 1 session of tutoring per week,
				excluding holidays. For students who are more than a grade level behind in reading or are in
				need of fast remediation, 2 - 3 sessions per week is recommended. Closing the gap in reading
				takes time and effort, so each child's progress will be closely monitored from week to week
				in order to design personalized lesson plans for their current needs. In addition, formal
				testing measures will be re-administered every 8 months to get an updated reading profile.

			<h2 class="h3">Where does tutoring take place?</h2>
			<p class="mt-2">
				Tutoring sessions are delivered in-person at my home office in Lake Magdalene, Florida.
				Parents are welcome to sit inside or drop off students and return at the end of the session.
				As a back-up when students are sick or there is inclement weather, I offer virtual tutoring
				through Zoom.
